Power BI Sales & Profit Dashboard | BoAt Electronics Dataset
I recently worked on a 3-page interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze sales, profit, customer behavior, and shipping trends for a leading electronics company (BoAt).

🔹 Key Insights:
 ✔️ Top-selling & most profitable categories/products. 
 ✔️ State-wise & customer segment-wise sales performance. 
 ✔️ Impact of discounts on profit. 
 ✔️ Most used & fastest shipping modes. 
 ✔️ Best & worst-performing months. 
📊 Tools Used: Power BI | DAX | Data Cleaning | Data Visualization. 
This dashboard provides actionable insights for business growth & decision-making. 🚀
